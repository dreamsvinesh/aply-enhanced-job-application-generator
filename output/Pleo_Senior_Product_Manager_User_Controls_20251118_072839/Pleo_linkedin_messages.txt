Hello! I'm interested in the Senior Product Manager - User & Controls position at Pleo. I've spent the last 2 years building user management systems and spend control workflows that solve exactly the kind of inefficient process challenges you're revolutionizing.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Built user permission frameworks for 600,000+ employees with complex spend approval workflows
• Collaborated with Finance and HR teams to reduce process time from 42 days to 10 minutes
• Led cross-functional team of 15+ engineers developing user access and budget enforcement systems
• Increased ARPA by 35% through user enablement and automated spend controls
• Achieved 91% satisfaction from finance professionals through empathetic problem-solving

What draws me to Pleo: Your mission to transform spend management through autonomy and trust resonates deeply with my product philosophy. The challenge of building market-leading user management capabilities while maintaining that Danish work-life balance culture is compelling.

I'm excited about the opportunity to work remotely from the Netherlands and contribute to Pleo's vision of helping companies "go beyond the books." The focus on empowering employees while maintaining financial control is exactly the kind of complex B2B problem I love solving.

Happy to discuss how my user management and spend control experience could contribute to your 2026 roadmap and continued market leadership!
