Subject: Application for Senior Product Manager - User & Controls (Vinesh Kumar)

Dear Pleo Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Senior Product Manager - User & Controls position at Pleo. With 6+ years of product management experience in user management systems, spend controls, and finance workflow automation, I'm excited about the opportunity to lead Pleo's user enablement and growth domain.

My experience directly aligns with your mission to revolutionize business spend management:

• Led user management and spend control systems for 600,000+ employees across multi-tenant environment
• Collaborated extensively with Finance and HR teams to transform inefficient processes into empowered experiences  
• Increased platform ARPA by 35% through user access optimization and automated approval workflows
• Led cross-functional teams of 15+ engineers developing user permission frameworks and budget enforcement
• Deep empathy for finance professionals gained through direct collaboration and user research

I'm particularly drawn to Pleo's vision of making spend management seamless and empowering. Your focus on autonomy, trust, and removing the headache of controlling spend while maintaining control resonates with my approach to product management. The opportunity to work on category-defining innovations in user enablement and access controls is exactly what energizes me.

The chance to collaborate with Rob Guard and contribute to Pleo's market-leading position while working remotely from the Netherlands aligns perfectly with my career goals and Pleo's values of transparency and work-life balance.

I'm excited about the possibility of helping Pleo continue its mission to shape the future of work and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in user management, spend controls, and finance team collaboration can contribute to your 2026 roadmap.

Best regards,
Vinesh Kumar
