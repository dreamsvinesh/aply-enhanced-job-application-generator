Dear Pleo Hiring Team,

I'm interested in the Senior Product Manager role for User & Controls at Pleo. I spent the last two years building user management systems and spend control workflows that solve exactly the kind of inefficient process challenges you're revolutionizing with your spend management platform.

Your mission to transform spend controls into an effortless experience sounds a lot like what I dig into. I led user enablement for COWRKS' platform serving 600,000+ employees with complex permission systems and spend approval workflows—the same kind of finance and HR empathy work you need for Pleo's user management domain.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Built user permission frameworks and spend control policies for 600K+ employees across 320+ locations
• Collaborated with Finance and HR teams to reduce process inefficiency from 42 days to 10 minutes
• Led cross-functional team of 15+ engineers developing user access and approval workflow systems
• Increased platform ARPA by 35% through user enablement and automated spend controls
• Achieved 91% satisfaction from finance professionals through empathetic problem-solving

What draws me to Pleo: You're revolutionizing how businesses manage spending by promoting autonomy and trust—exactly the philosophy I believe in. Your focus on empowering employees while maintaining financial control, combined with the challenge of building market-leading user management capabilities, is compelling. The opportunity to work with 850+ team members across 100+ nations while maintaining that Danish work-life balance is exciting.

The Netherlands remote setup sounds like the perfect environment to contribute to Pleo's mission of helping companies "go beyond the books."

Happy to discuss how my user management and spend control experience maps to what you're building at Pleo.

Best,
Vinesh Kumar
