Hi! I saw the founding Product Operations role at Dealfront and I'm very interested. My background building 0→1 product ops frameworks (scaled teams 10→50+) and AI automation (80% efficiency gains) aligns well. Would love to connect!

Hello! I'm interested in the founding Product Operations role at Dealfront. With my experience building product ops from 0→1 (scaled team 10→50+), implementing AI automation (80% manual work reduction), and achieving 95% process adoption, I believe I could contribute to your structured growth approach. Would you be open to a brief conversation about how my background aligns with Dealfront's needs?
