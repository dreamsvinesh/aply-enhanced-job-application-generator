Subject: Application: Founding Product Operations Role - Proven 0→1 Scaling Experience

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the founding Product Operations role at Dealfront. With 6+ years in product operations and a proven track record building process frameworks from 0→1 in high-growth SaaS environments, I am excited about the opportunity to establish the operating model for your scaling organization.

Key relevant experience:
• Built product operations infrastructure from 0→1 at TechCorp, scaling team from 10→50+ people
• Implemented AI-powered process automation reducing manual work by 80% and improving velocity by 35%
• Achieved 95% process adoption across product and engineering teams through structured enablement
• Improved roadmap delivery predictability by 40% via comprehensive planning cadences and governance

My experience directly aligns with Dealfront's need for structured enablement, intelligent prioritization, and measurable impact. I am particularly drawn to your AI-first culture and the opportunity to establish foundational systems that will enable continued scaling with precision and clarity.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in AI-enabled process automation and strategic operations can contribute to Dealfront's mission of transforming B2B go-to-market.

Best regards,
Vinesh Kumar
