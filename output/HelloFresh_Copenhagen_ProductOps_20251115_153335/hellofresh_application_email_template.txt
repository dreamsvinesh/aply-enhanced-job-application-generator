Dear HelloFresh Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Product Operations Manager position in Copenhagen, leveraging my extensive experience in food and beverage platform management.

With over 6 years of product management expertise, I have successfully scaled digital F&B platforms across 24 locations, demonstrating a track record closely aligned with HelloFresh's multi-market expansion strategy. In my current role at COWRKS, I've led complex menu management projects that required intricate operational coordination - a skill directly applicable to HelloFresh's dynamic weekly meal planning ecosystem.

My professional highlights include:
• Driving a digital platform to €20-22M annual GMV with 600,000+ users
• Managing cross-functional teams across Product, Operations, and Technology
• Implementing scalable operational processes in fast-moving consumer platforms

HelloFresh's mission of transforming how people eat and reducing food waste resonates deeply with my professional philosophy. I'm excited about the potential to contribute to your innovative meal kit solution and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your team's objectives.

I've attached my resume and would appreciate the chance to further discuss this role. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
