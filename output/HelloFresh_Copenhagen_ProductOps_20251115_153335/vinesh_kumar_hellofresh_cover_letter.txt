Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my profound interest in the Product Operations Manager role at HelloFresh in Copenhagen, where I see an extraordinary opportunity to drive innovation in how people experience food. With my background in scaling digital food platforms and optimizing complex operational ecosystems, I am excited to potentially contribute to HelloFresh's mission of transforming daily eating experiences.

At COWRKS, I successfully scaled a food and workplace platform from 1,330 to over 30,000 daily orders within six months—a 22.5X growth that generated €20-22M in annual GMV. This experience directly translates to HelloFresh's multi-market product strategy, demonstrating my ability to manage intricate menu planning and operational constraints across diverse market segments. My approach has consistently focused on data-driven optimization, increasing customer Net Promoter Score from 73% to 91% through strategic product enhancements.

My technical expertise in building AI-powered systems and automating complex processes positions me uniquely to drive operational efficiency. I've demonstrated the ability to reduce contract activation times from 42 days to just 10 minutes and led cross-functional teams to optimize 15+ operational processes. These skills align perfectly with HelloFresh's need for innovative product management that balances technological sophistication with practical, user-centric solutions.

I am particularly drawn to HelloFresh's transformative vision of changing how people eat forever. Copenhagen represents an ideal environment to continue this mission, and I am eager to bring my passion for food innovation and operational excellence to your team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can contribute to HelloFresh's continued growth and impact.

Sincerely,
Vinesh Kumar
