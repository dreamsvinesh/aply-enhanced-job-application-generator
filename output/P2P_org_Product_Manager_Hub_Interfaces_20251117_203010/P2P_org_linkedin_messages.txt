Hello! I'm interested in the Product Manager - Hub Interfaces position at P2P.org. I've spent the last 2 years building complex B2B dashboards and institutional client interfaces that solve exactly the kind of challenges you're tackling with the P2P Hub.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Built central dashboard serving 600,000+ users across 320+ institutional locations
• Collaborated with design and engineering on data-rich, performant interfaces
• Translated institutional client feedback into product requirements and roadmaps  
• Achieved 98.8% platform reliability and improved satisfaction from 73% to 91%
• Deep experience in complex web applications, analytics, and user engagement optimization

What draws me to P2P.org: You're the largest institutional staking provider ($10B TVL) with major clients like BitGo, Crypto.com, and Ledger. The technical challenges around building institutional-grade DeFi interfaces and staking dashboards are exactly what energizes me.

Your focus on data-rich performance insights and seamless user experiences for institutional staking aligns perfectly with my B2B platform development background. The opportunity to work on cutting-edge blockchain technology while solving real institutional UX problems is compelling.

Happy to discuss how my institutional interface expertise could contribute to P2P.org's continued innovation in the staking space!
