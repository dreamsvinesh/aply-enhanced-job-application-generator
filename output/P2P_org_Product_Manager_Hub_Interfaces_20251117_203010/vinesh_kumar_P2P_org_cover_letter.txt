Dear P2P.org Hiring Team,

I'm interested in the Product Manager - Hub Interfaces role at P2P.org. I spent the last two years building complex B2B dashboards and client-facing platforms that solve exactly the kind of institutional interface challenges you're tackling with the P2P Hub.

Your focus on institutional-grade UI/UX and data-rich interfaces sounds a lot like what I dig into. I owned the central dashboard for COWRKS' F&B platform serving 600,000+ users across 320+ institutional locations, which involved the same kind of complex interface management, performance analytics, and client feedback translation that you need for the P2P Hub.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Built institutional-grade dashboards serving 600K+ users across multi-tenant environments
• Collaborated with design and engineering teams on data-rich, performant interfaces
• Translated feedback from 320+ institutional clients into product requirements and roadmaps
• Achieved 98.8% platform reliability through interface optimization and UX improvements
• Improved client satisfaction from 73% to 91% through dashboard feature development

What draws me to P2P.org: You're the largest institutional staking provider ($10B TVL) working with major clients like BitGo, Crypto.com, and Ledger. The technical challenges around building institutional-grade DeFi interfaces, staking dashboards, and performance analytics are exactly what energizes me. The opportunity to work on cutting-edge blockchain technology while solving real institutional user experience problems is compelling.

The fully remote culture and focus on DeFi innovation aligns perfectly with my interests in fintech product development.

Happy to discuss how my B2B platform experience maps to what you're building at P2P.org.

Best,
Vinesh Kumar
