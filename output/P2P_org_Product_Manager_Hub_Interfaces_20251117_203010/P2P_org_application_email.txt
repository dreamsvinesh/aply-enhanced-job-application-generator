Subject: Application for Product Manager - Hub Interfaces (Vinesh Kumar)

Dear P2P.org Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Product Manager - Hub Interfaces position at P2P.org. With 6+ years of product management experience building complex B2B dashboards and client-facing platforms for institutional users, I'm excited about the opportunity to lead development of the P2P Hub interface.

My experience directly aligns with your requirements for institutional-grade interface development:

• Built central dashboard for F&B platform serving 600,000+ users across 320+ institutional locations
• Collaborated with design and engineering teams on data-rich, performant interfaces with real-time analytics
• Translated feedback from institutional clients into product requirements and roadmap priorities
• Achieved 98.8% platform reliability and improved client satisfaction from 73% to 91%
• Deep experience in complex web application interfaces, user metrics analysis, and feature iteration

I'm particularly drawn to P2P.org's position as the largest institutional staking provider with clients like BitGo, Crypto.com, and Ledger. The opportunity to work on cutting-edge DeFi interfaces, staking dashboards, and institutional-grade user experiences aligns perfectly with my fintech product management background.

The challenge of building interfaces that enable seamless asset staking and provide comprehensive performance insights for institutional clients is exactly the kind of complex B2B product development I'm passionate about.

I'm excited about the fully remote work culture and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my B2B platform expertise can contribute to P2P.org's continued growth and innovation in the institutional staking space.

Best regards,
Vinesh Kumar
