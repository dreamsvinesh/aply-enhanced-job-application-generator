Subject: Application: Founding Product Operations Role - Proven 0→1 Scaling & AI Automation Experience

Dear Dealfront Team,

I am writing to apply for the founding Product Operations role at Dealfront. With 7 years in product management and a proven track record building product operations frameworks from 0→1 in high-growth SaaS environments, I am excited about the opportunity to establish the operating model for your scaling organization.

Key relevant experience from my current role at COWRKS:
• Built AI RAG system achieving 94% accuracy, serving 200+ employees in 1,500+ weekly queries through intelligent automation
• Automated contract workflows reducing timeline 99.6% from 42 days to 10 minutes, accelerating $2M revenue recognition
• Led automation rollout achieving 100% adoption across 5 departments in 2 weeks through structured change management
• Cut support tickets 75% (500→125 monthly) through AI-powered process optimization

My background directly addresses Dealfront's need for AI-enabled process automation, structured enablement systems, and measurable impact delivery. Having built product operations infrastructure that enabled team scaling from 10→50+ people while maintaining execution velocity, I understand the frameworks and rhythms required for rapid scaling with accountability.

I am particularly drawn to Denmark's direct, results-oriented business culture and Dealfront's focus on speed, precision, and simplicity. My experience securing CEO approval for $2M investments through data-driven presentations and delivering consistent measurable outcomes aligns well with your success metrics around roadmap predictability and process adoption.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven experience in 0→1 product operations can establish the foundation that enables Dealfront's Product Core & Growth and Tech teams to execute with clarity and velocity.

Best regards,
Vinesh Kumar
