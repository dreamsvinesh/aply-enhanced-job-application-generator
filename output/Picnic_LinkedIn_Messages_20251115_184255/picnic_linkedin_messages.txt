Hi! I saw the Product Manager role at Picnic and I'm very interested. My experience scaling F&B platforms from 1,330 to 30,000+ daily orders across 24 locations directly aligns with your delivery operations focus. Would love to connect!

Hello! I'm interested in the Product Manager position at Picnic. I've spent the last 2 years scaling COWRKS' food platform from 1,330 to 30,000+ daily orders (generating €20M+ GMV), which sounds very similar to the challenges you're solving at Picnic.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Built operations layer for 30K+ daily orders across 24 business locations  
• Increased delivery completion rate to 99.9% and NPS from 73% to 91%
• Automated processes reducing activation time from 42 days to 10 minutes

What draws me to Picnic: You're revolutionizing grocery delivery with a unique model, and the technical challenges around logistics optimization and customer experience are exactly what I love working on.

Happy to discuss how my platform scaling experience could help with Picnic's continued growth.
