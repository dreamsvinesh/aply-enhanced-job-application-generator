Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm interested in the Technical Product Manager role at Agoda in Bangkok. I spent the last two years building internal tools and platforms at COWRKS that solve exactly the kind of operational excellence challenges you're tackling at Agoda.

The workflow optimization and AI automation work sounds a lot like what I dig into. I built an AI-powered knowledge management system achieving 94% accuracy for internal support, and automated processes that reduced contract activation from 42 days to 10 minutes—freeing up teams to focus on harder problems.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Led internal platform development serving 600,000+ users across 320+ locations
• Built performance tracking systems that improved operational efficiency by 60%
• Automated cross-functional workflows saving 50+ resource hours daily
• Implemented OKR tracking tools that increased team velocity 5X

What draws me to Agoda: You're operating at incredible scale (4.7M properties, 7,100+ employees) and the technical challenges around operational excellence across global tech teams are exactly what energizes me. The focus on LLM automation and internal tool innovation aligns perfectly with my experience.

Bangkok seems like the right place to keep working on this problem at travel industry scale.

Happy to discuss how my internal platform experience maps to what you're building.

Best,
Vinesh Kumar
