# RESUME ANALYSIS: Original vs Communications-Focused

Generated: 2025-11-14 21:50:14

## MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN ORIGINAL RESUME:

❌ **Wrong Focus**: Original emphasized AI/ML, RAG systems, vector databases
✅ **Correct Focus**: Should emphasize communication platforms, messaging infrastructure

❌ **Wrong Keywords**: "RAG architecture", "LLM integration", "vector databases"  
✅ **Correct Keywords**: "messaging infrastructure", "email/SMS systems", "communication APIs"

❌ **Wrong Experience**: Highlighted AI knowledge systems and machine learning
✅ **Correct Experience**: Highlighted messaging workflows, communication platforms, external integrations

## ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM:

1. **JD Parser Bug**: Substring matching incorrectly flagged "r" in words like "platforms" as AI/ML keyword
2. **Wrong Classification**: 88% AI/ML focus calculated due to false keyword matches
3. **Wrong Resume Variant**: System selected "aiml" variant instead of "communications/platform" variant

## CORRECTED RESUME HIGHLIGHTS:

✅ **Communication Platform Experience**: 2M+ notifications monthly, 600K+ users
✅ **Messaging Infrastructure**: Email/SMS systems, delivery reliability, lifecycle automation  
✅ **External Partner Integration**: Twilio, SendGrid, API-driven systems
✅ **Platform Management**: Scalable messaging, system health monitoring, compliance
✅ **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Reduced communication failures, support ticket reduction
✅ **Business Impact**: $2M revenue acceleration through automated communication workflows

## SQUARESPACE JOB REQUIREMENTS MAPPING:

JD Requirement → Resume Evidence
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Communication products: emails, reminders, notifications" → "2M+ notifications monthly across email and SMS"
"Messaging platform that delivers messages reliably" → "99.9% delivery reliability"  
"External communication partners" → "Integrated with Twilio, SendGrid"
"API-driven and service-oriented systems" → "API-driven messaging platform"
"Monitor system health, reliability" → "Monitored system health and delivery metrics"
"Scalable, compliant, and resilient messaging" → "Scalable messaging platform with compliance standards"

This corrected resume is now properly aligned with the Squarespace Acuity Communications role!
