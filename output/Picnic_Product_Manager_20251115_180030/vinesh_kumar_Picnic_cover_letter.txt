Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm interested in the Product Manager role at Picnic in the Netherlands. 

I spent the last two years scaling COWRKS' food platform from 1,330 to 30,000+ daily orders (22.5X growth, €20M+ GMV). The complexity of building an efficient, tech-driven food delivery system sounds exactly like the kind of challenge Picnic is tackling.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Increased NPS from 73% to 91% by fixing actual customer friction points
• Automated contract workflows, reducing processing time from 42 days to 10 minutes
• Built an operations layer supporting 30K+ daily orders across 24 locations

What draws me to Picnic: Your mission of making grocery delivery more sustainable and efficient. The way you're reimagining logistics with electric vehicles and smart routing is fascinating.

The Netherlands seems like the perfect ecosystem to keep pushing these innovations forward. I've been tracking how Dutch tech companies solve complex urban mobility challenges, and Picnic is leading that charge.

Happy to discuss how my experience maps to what you're building.

Best,
Vinesh Kumar
