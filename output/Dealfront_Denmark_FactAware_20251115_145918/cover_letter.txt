Dear Dealfront Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the founding Product Operations role at Dealfront. With my experience building product operations frameworks from 0→1 in high-growth SaaS environments, I am excited about establishing the operating model for your scaling organization.

My background directly addresses Dealfront's need for AI-enabled process automation, structured enablement systems, and measurable impact delivery.

Best regards,
Vinesh Kumar
