Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm interested in the Product Manager role at Picnic-Test in the Netherlands. I spent the last two years scaling COWRKS' food platform from 1,330 to 30,000+ daily orders (22.5X growth, €20M+ GMV).

Your challenge of building an efficient, tech-driven grocery delivery platform sounds exactly like the kind of problem I dig into. The complexity of managing hyper-local logistics and customer experience is something I've lived and breathed.

A few things I've done that might be relevant:
• Increased NPS from 73% to 91% by fixing actual customer friction points
• Automated contract workflows, reducing processing time from 42 days to 10 minutes
• Built operations infrastructure supporting 30K+ daily orders across 24 locations

What draws me to Picnic-Test: Your commitment to reimagining grocery delivery through technology. The Netherlands seems like the perfect ecosystem to keep pushing these logistics innovations forward.

Happy to discuss how my experience maps to what you're building.

Best,
Vinesh Kumar
